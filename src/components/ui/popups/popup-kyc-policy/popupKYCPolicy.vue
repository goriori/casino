          territory of another Member State or in that of a third country.<br />

          Organization of the AML for jetton.games<br />
          In accordance with the AML legislation, jetton.games has appointed the
          “highest level” for the prevention of ML: The full management of
          JetTon B.V. are in charge.<br /><br />

          Furthermore, an AMLCO (Anti Money Laundering Compliance Officer) is in
          charge of the enforcement of the AML policy and procedures within the
          System.<br />

          The AMLCO is placed under the direct responsibility of the general
          Management:<br /><br />

          AML policy changes and implementation requirements:<br />
          Each major change of jetton.games AML policy is subject to be approval
          by the general management of JetTon B.V. and the Anti money laundering
          compliance officer.<br /><br />

          Three step Verification:<br />
          Step one verification:<br />
          Step one verification must be done by every user and customer to
          withdraw. Regarding of the choice of payment, the amount of payment,
          the amount of withdraw, the choice of withdraw and nationality of the
          user/customer step one verification must be done first. Step one
          verification is a document that must be filled out by the
          user/customer himself. Following information’s must be filled in:
          first name, second name, date of birth, country of usual residence,
          gender and full address.<br /><br />

          Step two verification:<br />
          Step two verification must be done by every user which deposit over
          2000$ (two thousand Dollar) or withdraws over 2000$ (two thousand
          Dollar) or sends another user over 1000$ (one thousand Dollar) Until
          step two verification is done the withdraw, tip or deposit will be
          hold. Step to verification will lead the user or customer to a subpage
          where he must send in his ID. The user/customer must make a picture of
          his ID. While a paperclip with a six-digit random generated number is
          next to his ID: Only an official ID may be used for ID verification,
          depending on the country the variety of accepted IDs may be different.
          There will also be an electronic check if the filled in Data from the
          step one verification is correct. The electronic check will check via
          two different databanks to insure the given information’s matches with
          the filled document and the name from the ID: If the electronic test
          fails or is not possible the user/customer is required to send in a
          conformation of his current resident. A certificate of registration by
          the government or a similar document is required.<br /><br />

          Step three verification:<br />
          Step three verification must be done by every user which deposit over
          5000$ (five thousand Dollar) or withdraws over 5000$ (five thousand
          Dollar) or sends another user over 3000$ (three thousand Dollar) Until
          step three verification is done the withdraw, tip or deposit will be
          hold. For step 3 a user/customer will be asked for a source of
          wealth.<br /><br />

          Customer identification and verification (KYC)<br />
          The formal identification of customers on entry into commercial
          relations is a vital element, both for the regulations relating to
          money laundering and for the KYC policy.<br /><br />

          This identification relies on the following fundamental principles:<br /><br />

          A copy of your passport, ID card or driving license, each shown
          alongside a handwritten note mentioning six random generated numbers.
          Also, a second picture with the face of the user/customer is required.
          The user/customer may blur out every information, besides date of
          birth, nationality, gender, first name, second name and the picture.
          To secure their privacy.<br /><br />

          Please note that all four corners of the ID have to be visible in the
          same image and all details has to be clearly readable besides the
          named above. We might ask for all details if necessary.<br /><br />

          An employee may do additional checks if necessary, based on the
          situation.<br /><br />

          Proof of Address:<br />
          Proof of address will be done via to different electronic checks,
          which use two different databases. If an electronic test fails, the
          user/customer has the option to make a manually proof.<br /><br />

          A recent utility bill sent to your registered address, issued within
          the last 3 months or an official document made by the government that
          proofs your state of residence.<br /><br />

          To make the approval process as speedy as possible, please make sure
          the document is sent with a clear resolution where all four corners of
          the document is visible, and all text is readable.<br /><br />

          For example: An electricity bill, water bill, bank statement or any
          governmental post addressed to you.<br /><br />

          An employee may do additional checks if necessary, based on the
          situation.<br /><br />

          Source of funds<br />
          If a player deposits over a five thousand euro there is a process of
          understandings the source of wealth (SOW)<br /><br />

          Examples of SOW are:<br /><br />

          Ownership of business<br />
          Employment<br />
          Inheritance<br />
          Investment<br />
          Family<br />
          It is critical that the origin and legitimacy of that wealth is
          clearly understood. If this is not possible an employee may ask for an
          additional document or prove.<br /><br />

          The account will be frozen if the same user deposits either this
          amount in one go or multiple transactions which amount to this. An
          email will be sent to them manually to go through the above and an
          information on the website itself.<br /><br />

          jetton.games also asks for a bank wire/credit card to further insure
          the Identity of the user/customer. It also gives additional
          information about the financial situation of the user/customer.<br /><br />

          Basic document for step one:<br />
          The basic document will be accessible via the setting page on
          jetton.games. Every user has to fill out the following
          information’s:<br /><br />

          First name<br />
          Second name<br />
          Nationality<br />
          Gender<br />
          Date of Birth<br />
          The document will be saved and created by an AI, an employee may do
          additional checks if necessary based on the situation.<br /><br />

          Risk management:<br />
          In order to deal with the different risks and different states of
          wealth in different regions on the earth jetton.games will categorize
          every nation in three different regions of risk.<br /><br />

          Region one: Low risk:<br />
          For every nation from the region one the three-step verification is
          done as described earlier.<br /><br />

          Region two: Medium risk:<br />
          For every nation from the region two the three-step verification will
          be done at lower deposit, withdraw and tip amounts. Step one will be
          done as usually. Step two will be done after depositing 1000$ (one
          thousand Dollars), withdrawing 1000$ (one thousand Dollars) or tipping
          another user/customer 500$ (five hundred Dollars.) Step three will be
          done after depositing 2500$ (two thousand five hundred Dollars),
          withdrawing 2500$ (two thousand five hundred Dollars) or tipping
          another user/customer 1000$ (one thousand Dollars). Also, users from a
          low risk region that change crypto currency in any other currency will
          be treated like user/customers from a medium risk region.<br /><br />

          Region three: High risk:<br />
          Regions of high risks will be banned. High risk regions will be
          regularly updated to keep up with the changing environment of a
          fast-changing world.<br /><br />

          Additional measurements.<br />
          In addition, an AI which is overseen by the AML compliance officer
          will look for any unusual behaviour and report it right away to a
          employee of jetton.games<br /><br />

          According to a risk based few and general experience the human
          employees will recheck all checks which are done bevor by the AI or
          other employees and may redo or do additional checks according to the
          situation.<br /><br />

          In addition, a data Scientist supported by modern, electronic,
          analytic systems will look for unusual behaviour like: Depositing and
          withdrawing without longer Betting sessions. Attempts to use a
          different Bank account to for Deposit and Withdraw, nationality
          changes, currency changes, behaviour and activity changes as well as
          checks, if an account is used by it´s original owner.<br /><br />

          Also a User has to use the same method for Withdraw as he used for
          Deposit, for the amount of the initial Deposit to prevent any Money
          Laundering.<br /><br />

          Enterprise-wide risk assessment<br />
          As part of its risk-based approach, jetton.games has conducted an AML
          “Enterprise-wide risk assessment” (EWRA) to identify and understand
          risks specific to jetton.games and its business lines. The AML risk
          policy is determined after identifying and documenting the risks
          inherent to its business lines such as the services the website
          offers. The Users to whom services are offered, transactions performed
          by these Users, delivery channels used by the bank, the geographic
          locations of the bank’s operations, customers and transactions and
          other qualitative and emerging risks.<br /><br />

          The identification of AML risk categories is based on jetton.games
          understanding of regulatory requirements, regulatory expectations and
          industry guidance. Additional safety measures are taken to take care
          of the additional risks the world wide web brings with it.<br /><br />

          The EWRA is yearly reassessed.<br /><br />

          Ongoing transaction monitoring<br />
          AML-Compliance ensures that an “ongoing transaction monitoring” is
          conducted to detect transactions which are unusual or suspicious
          compared to the customer profile. This transaction monitoring is
          conducted on two levels:<br /><br />

          The first Line of Control:<br /><br />

          jetton.games works solely with trusted Payment Service Providers whom
          all have effective AML policies in place as to prevent the large
          majority of suspicious deposits onto jetton.games from taking place
          without proper execution of KYC procedures onto the potential
          customer.<br /><br />

          The second Line of Control:<br /><br />

          jetton.games makes its network aware so that any contact with the
          customer or player or authorized representative must give rise to the
          exercise of due diligence on transactions on the account concerned. In
          particular these include:<br /><br />

          Requests for the execution of financial transactions on the
          account;<br />
          Requests in relation to means of payment or services on the
          account;<br />
          Also, the three-step verification with adjusted risk management should
          provide all necessary information’s about all costumers of
          jetton.games at all time.<br /><br />

          Also, all transaction must be overseen by employees over watched by
          the AML compliance officer who is over watched by the general
          management.<br /><br />

          The specific transactions submitted to the customer support manager,
          possibly through their Compliance Manager must also be subject to due
          diligence.<br /><br />

          Determination of the unusual nature of one or more transactions
          essentially depends on a subjective assessment, in relation to the
          knowledge of the customer (KYC), their financial behaviour and the
          transaction counterparty.<br /><br />

          These checks will be done by an automated System, while an Employee
          crosschecks them for additional security.<br /><br />

          The transactions observed on customer accounts for which it is
          difficult to gain a proper understanding of the lawful activities and
          origin of funds must therefore rapidly be considered atypical (as they
          are not directly justifiable).<br /><br />

          Any jetton.games staff member must inform the AML division of any
          atypical transactions which they observe and cannot attribute to a
          lawful activity or source of income known of the customer.<br /><br />

          The third Line of Control:<br /><br />

          As a last line of defence against AML jetton.games will do manually
          checks on all suspicious and higher risk users in order to fully
          prevent money laundering.<br /><br />

          If fraud or Money Laundering is found the authorities will be
          informed.<br /><br />

          Reporting of Suspicious transactions on jetton.games<br />
          In its internal procedures, jetton.games describes in precise terms,
          for the attention of its staff members, when it is necessary to report
          and how to proceed with such reporting.<br /><br />

          Reports of atypical transactions are analysed within the AML team in
          accordance with the precise methodology fully described in the
          internal procedures.<br /><br />

          Depending on the result of this examination and on the basis of the
          information gathered, the AML team:<br /><br />

          will decide whether it is necessary or not to send a report to the
          FIU, in accordance with the legal obligations provided in the Law of
          18 September 2017;<br />
          will decide whether or not it is necessary to terminate the business
          relations with the customer. Procedures<br />
          The AML rules, including minimum KYC standards will be translated into
          operational guidance or procedures that are available on the Intranet
          site of jetton.games<br /><br />

          Record keeping<br />
          Records of data obtained for the purpose of identification must be
          kept for at least ten years after the business relationship has
          ended.<br /><br />

          Records of all transaction data must be kept for at least ten years
          following the carrying-out of the transactions or the end of the
          business relationship.<br /><br />

          These data will be safely, encrypted stored offline and online.<br /><br />

          Training:<br />
          jetton.games human employees will make manual controls on a risk based
          approve for which they get special training.<br /><br />

          The training and awareness program is reflected by its usage:<br /><br />

          A mandatory AML training program in accordance with the latest
          regulatory evolutions, for all in touch with finances Academic AML
          learning sessions for all new employees<br />
          The content of this training program has to be established in
          accordance with the kind of business the trainees are working for and
          the posts they hold. These sessions are given by an AML-specialist
          working in JetTon B.V. AML team.<br /><br />

          Auditing<br />
          Internal audit regularly establishes missions and reports about AML
          activities.<br /><br />

          Data Security:<br />
          All data given by any user/customer will be kept secure, will not be
          sold or given to anyone else. Only if forced by law, or to prevent
          money laundering data may be shared with the AML-authority of the
          affected state.<br /><br />

          jetton.games will follow all guidelines and rules of the data
          protection directive (officially Directive 95/46/EC)<br />
