          The JetTon will be processing Your Personal Data (as defined in our
          Privacy Notice) from the moment You register on our Platform. Due to
          legal and regulatory requirements (i.e. licensing requirements and

          We may share the Personal Data provided during the registration
          process or later with external third parties that provide the Platform
          with services. However, these external parties may only use Your
          Personal Data for the same purposes as the JetTon shall specify and
          within these Terms and Conditions and the Privacy Notice. By agreeing
          to these Terms and Conditions and the Privacy Notice and using the
          Platform, You hereby give Your consent for the purposes of all and any
          data protection legislation and related regulations, for the JetTon,
          to share and transfer necessary personal data to such external third
          parties.<br /><br />

          On the Platform can be registered only 1 (one) game account for one
          Player, telegram username, IP, mailing address, computer or any other
          device.<br /><br />

          When registering on the Platform, the Player undertakes to provide
          reliable and true information about himself / herself. In order to
          confirm the information provided by the Player, the JetTon has the
          right to request verification at any time by asking the Player to
          provide relevant identity document(s) (including, but not limited to,
          a copy / photo of the Player's ID / ID cards / or any payment card(s)
          used with Player’s name on it). An example of such a case would be
          when the Player has amassed a cumulative deposit amount of $2,000 over
          a rolling period of 180 (one hundred and eighty) days. In case the
          Player does not provide the requested copies / photos of the identity
          documents requested by the JetTon, the provided information is deemed
          to be unverified / false. It is the violation of these Terms and
          Conditions and Jetton KYC Policy and can be interpreted by JetTon as
          fraudulent activities.<br /><br />

          The Player confirms that during registration on the Platform, he
          provided accurate, complete and reliable information about
          himself/herself, and in the event of any changes, undertakes to update
          and / or amend this information. Non-compliance with this requirement
          may lead to the blocking of the Player’s game account.<br /><br />

          Duplicating game accounts. It is not allowed to create a duplicate
          game account. Re-registration of another game account is allowed only
          with the consent of the JetTon in cases of loss of data for access to
          the active game account by the Player or any other reason, which the
          Player must immediately notify the JetTon. In case of re-registration
          or attempting to re-register, the JetTon has the right to block or
          close all or any of the game accounts registered under the Player’s
          name. The JetTon, in its sole discretion, can render ineffective all
          bets placed via the duplicate game account(s).<br />
          In the event that the JetTon decides to allow the Player to continue
          to use the Platform services, the accounts will be managed so that the
          Player will have only one (1) active game account to which the game
          balance from the duplicate account(s) created by the Player will be
          transferred.<br /><br />

          If the Player has registered separate game accounts within the
          Platform, these separate accounts shall be merged into the single game
          account.<br /><br />

          The decision to refund the monies, which can be on the bonus or real
          balance side of the duplicate game account(s), is made by the JetTon
          unilaterally.<br /><br />

          The Platform does not accept requests to refund any monies and / or
          initial deposits from the duplicate game account(s), if opened
          intentionally with the purpose of receiving bonuses and / or other
          promotional offers from the Platform or to refund the initial deposit
          placed by the Player. Further, if the JetTon determines that the
          duplicate game account was created with the intention to defraud the
          Platform the initial deposit(s)s will not be refunded to the
          Player.<br /><br />

          For avoidance of any doubt, the Platform does not allow the
          registration of game account(s) for legal entities.<br /><br />

          IDENTITY AUTHENTICATION OF THE PLAYER<br /><br />

          By agreeing to the Terms and Conditions, the Player grants the JetTon
          the right to periodically verify the Player's identity and contact
          information ("Verification") both on the basis of the JetTon's
          decision or at the request of a third party (e.g. a regulatory
          authority).<br />
          During the Verification, the JetTon may limit withdrawal of funds by
          the Player from his game account.<br />
          In the case the Player provided false, inaccurate, misleading and / or
          otherwise incomplete, or not supported by the documents requested by
          the JetTon, information, the Player's actions are deemed to be a

          other suspected security violation. Upon the request of the JetTon,
          the Player also agrees to provide proof about the alleged unauthorized
          access. The JetTon is not responsible for any damage as incurred by
          the Player due to an unauthorized access or incorrect use of his
          username and password (login details) by a third party, regardless of
          whether these actions were authorized by the Player or took place
          without his knowledge.<br /><br />

          unchanged or will be changed for the better. The Player may not assign
          or otherwise transfer in any manner his rights or obligations under
          these Terms and Conditions.<br /><br />
          THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF INSUPERABLE FORCE<br /><br />

          The Jetton is not responsible in the event of non-fulfilment or delay
          in the performance of any of its obligations, which are caused by
          insuperable force circumstances. Insuperable force circumstances
          include natural disasters, wars, civil unrest, interruptions in public
          communication networks or services, industrial disruptions or DDOS
          attacks and similar Internet attacks that may have adverse
          consequences ("Force Majeure").<br />
          For the period of force-majeure circumstances, the activity of the
          Jetton is considered to be held, and the fulfilment of obligations is
          postponed. The JetTon undertakes to use all possible resources to
          eliminate Force Majeure and fulfil its obligations.<br /><br />
          WAIVER<br /><br />

          If the JetTon fails in ensuring the strict fulfilment of any of the
          obligations, this is by no means a refusal to fulfil its obligations
          and does not relieve the Player from compliance with his
          obligations.<br />
          The refusal of the JetTon to fulfil any of the obligations is not
          legally valid unless it is properly executed and transferred to the
          Player in writing.<br /><br />
          SEPARABILITY OF THE AGREEMENT<br /><br />

          If any provision of these Terms and Conditions becomes invalid,
          illegal or at any degree lost its legal efficacy, such provision shall
          be separated from the remaining provisions of these Terms and
          Conditions and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and
          effect. In such cases, the part that is considered invalid varies
          according to the applicable law.<br /><br />
          GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION<br /><br />

          These Terms and Conditions are governed by the laws of Curacao.<br />
          Any disputes that may arise on the basis of these Terms and Conditions
          are to be considered in the courts of Curacao. The JetTon cannot be
          held responsible for the legislation of other countries.<br /><br />
