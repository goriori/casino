          1. Introduction<br /><br />

          This Self-Restraint Policy outlines the procedures and guidelines set
          forth by JetTon Gaming Platform operating under the Curacao license

          promote responsible gaming and support players who wish to
          self-restraint from our platform and addictive gaming.<br />
          If you think you have started spending more money than you can afford,
          or if the game is starting to interfere with your daily routine,
          JetTon strongly recommends you consider a few measures that may help,
          i.e. to set personal time or deposit limits, or activate either
          Cooling-Off or Self-Exclusion feature.<br /><br />

          2. Self-Assessment<br /><br />

          JetTon stands on responsible gaming principles. We have adopted number
          of measures that will allow our players play games in a responsible
          manner. The basis of prevention and control gaming addiction is fair
          self-assessment.<br />
          Below we present several statements that will help to determine if you
          have problems with gaming. If you find that 3-4 of these statements
          are true for your online gaming activity or for your friend’s game, we
          recommend to seek out professional help from specialists:<br />
          Thoughts about the game take most of Your time;<br />
          To achieve the desired level of joy You need to play with larger
          amounts;<br />
          You have difficulty with emotions control. You react keenly to normal
          daily routines;<br />
          In case of loss, You get hysterical and become aggressive;<br />
          You have repeatedly made unsuccessful attempts to control, reduce or
          stop the gaming;<br />
          Termination or reduction of playing time makes You annoyed or
          anxious;<br />
          Playing in online games is a way for You to avoid problems or get rid
          of a depressed mood;<br />
          After an unsuccessful gaming session, You play again to return the
          lost amount of money;<br />

          You expect or are confident that the others will help You to solve the
          financial problems caused by gaming.<br /><br />

          3. Self-Control<br /><br />

          The main thing is always balanced decisions about how much money you
          can spend. You are not threatened by gambling addiction, if your
          actions are under control. You need to take the issue of preventing
          ludomania seriously, having decided on a clear sequence of actions:<br />
          Play for a limited amount of time: Define for yourself the time You
          spend on games. If you have problems with this, set a timer or alarm
          for a specific time when you want to end up a gaming session before
          starting the game.<br />
          Manage the budget properly: Determine the maximum amount of the
          deposit and do not exceed it. Never borrow money to gamble.<br />
          Find a new hobby: Find a new hobby and combine it with the game.<br />
          Good mood = good game: Never play if you are depressed or stressed.<br />
          Sober Play: We strongly recommend You don’t drink alcohol
          before/during playing JetTon’s games.<br /><br />

          4. If You think that You start spending more money than you can
